<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: February 16, 2026</p>

<h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
<p>By using IPLoop's services, software, or website, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the service.</p>

<h2>2. The Service</h2>
<p>IPLoop operates a peer-to-peer proxy network. Participants ("nodes") share unused bandwidth and earn credits. Credits can be used for proxy access. IPLoop facilitates this exchange.</p>

<h2>3. Bandwidth Sharing Agreement</h2>
<ul>
<li>By running an IPLoop node, you agree to share your device's internet bandwidth with the IPLoop network.</li>
<li>Only HTTPS traffic is routed through your node. Traffic is encrypted and not inspected.</li>
<li>You are responsible for ensuring bandwidth sharing complies with your ISP's terms of service.</li>
<li>IPLoop does not guarantee specific bandwidth usage levels or earnings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Credit System</h2>
<ul>
<li>Credits are earned based on uptime hours and device count.</li>
<li>Uptime streaks provide multiplier bonuses (1.5× at 24h+, 2× at 72h+).</li>
<li>Credits can be spent on proxy access at the rate of 10 credits = 1 GB.</li>
<li>Credits have no monetary value and cannot be exchanged for cash.</li>
<li>IPLoop reserves the right to adjust credit rates and multipliers.</li>
<li>Fraudulent credit accumulation (fake nodes, manipulation) will result in account termination.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree NOT to use IPLoop for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any illegal activity under applicable law</li>
<li>Distributing malware, spam, or phishing</li>
<li>Attacking, scanning, or exploiting other systems</li>
<li>Circumventing security measures or access controls</li>
<li>Infringing intellectual property rights</li>
<li>Any activity that could damage IPLoop's reputation or network</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Account Termination</h2>
<p>IPLoop may suspend or terminate your account at any time for violation of these terms, abuse, or at our sole discretion. Upon termination, accumulated credits are forfeited. You may stop using the service at any time by uninstalling the node software.</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>IPLoop is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
<ul>
<li>IPLoop is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</li>
<li>IPLoop is not responsible for the content of traffic routed through the network.</li>
<li>IPLoop's total liability shall not exceed the value of credits in your account.</li>
<li>IPLoop is not liable for service interruptions, data loss, or security breaches.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify IPLoop against any claims arising from your use of the service or violation of these terms.</p>

<h2>9. Modifications</h2>
<p>IPLoop may modify these terms at any time. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. Material changes will be communicated via the website or dashboard.</p>

<h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These terms are governed by the laws of Israel. Disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Tel Aviv, Israel.</p>
