Hi [Name],

Quick question: what percentage of your users never make an in-app purchase or click an ad?

For most apps, it's 95%+. That's revenue sitting on the table.

IPLoop's SDK lets you monetize those users ethically — by sharing a small amount of their unused internet bandwidth. Users opt in, you earn recurring revenue, and there's zero disruption to their experience.

No ads. No paywalls. No user friction.

We're a proxy infrastructure company that pays developers to contribute bandwidth to our global network. Our SDK:
- Integrates in hours, not weeks
- Runs silently in the background
- Complies with all major privacy regulations
- Works alongside your existing monetization

Can I send over our integration guide so you can see how simple it is?

[Your Name]
IPLoop | iploop.io

### Version 3: Social Proof & Urgency
```
Subject: How app developers are earning $500+ CPM without ads

Hi [Name],

App developers are discovering a new monetization method that doesn't involve ads or purchases — bandwidth sharing via SDK.

Here's the model: users opt-in to share idle bandwidth, you earn recurring revenue per active user. Simple, ethical, and growing fast.

IPLoop provides:
✅ Lightweight SDK — 2-hour integration
✅ Up to $500 CPM on opted-in users
✅ Full GDPR/CCPA compliance

# PART 9: KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

## 9.1 What Every Successful Competitor Does

1. **Free tier or trial** — Every single competitor offers free access. Non-negotiable.
2. **Affiliate programs at 30-50%** — The industry standard is generous commissions
3. **Content marketing** — All leaders invest heavily in blogs, tutorials, comparison pages
4. **Review platform presence** — G2, Trustpilot, Capterra, PCMag — social proof everywhere
5. **Self-serve first** — Even enterprise players enable self-serve signup
6. **AI positioning** — Everyone is pivoting messaging to "AI-ready" or "for AI teams"
7. **Compliance messaging** — GDPR, CCPA, ethical sourcing, KYC — trust is table stakes
8. **24/7 support** — All major players offer round-the-clock support
9. **Developer focus** — Code examples, APIs, GitHub repos, documentation-first
10. **Multi-channel acquisition** — Blog + YouTube + Affiliates + Reviews + Paid ads

## 9.2 Gaps We Can Exploit

1. **Price aggression:** Most competitors charge $1.50-8/GB. If we can undercut AND maintain quality, we win SMB market
2. **SDK messaging is weak:** Honeygain is the only strong SDK player. Their messaging is decent but we can be more specific about revenue
3. **Telegram-native sales:** No competitor is doing serious Telegram outreach. This is our channel advantage
4. **Speed of onboarding:** If we can get someone from signup to working proxy in <60 seconds, we beat everyone
5. **No AI story required:** The market is screaming "AI-ready" but what customers actually want is reliable, affordable proxies. We can be refreshingly direct
6. **SDK competition is thin:** Only Honeygain has a serious SDK play. The rest either don't have one or it's an afterthought
7. **Community-first approach:** Build a Telegram/Discord community before trying to sell. Webshare's 120K active users show PLG works

## 9.3 What IPLoop Must Have From Day One

1. ✅ **Free tier** (no credit card required)
2. ✅ **Visible pricing** on the website
3. ✅ **Affiliate/partner program** (start at 30%, scale to 50%)
4. ✅ **API documentation** with code examples (Python, Node.js, Java minimum)
5. ✅ **Blog** with at least 5-10 SEO-optimized articles
6. ✅ **G2 and Trustpilot profiles** set up
7. ✅ **24/7 support** (even if it's just live chat + email)
8. ✅ **"Start free" CTA** on every page
9. ✅ **SDK integration guide** for partners
10. ✅ **Comparison pages** (IPLoop vs Bright Data, IPLoop vs Oxylabs, etc.)

---

> **SHADOW:** That's the complete intelligence package. Every competitor's playbook, decoded. The messaging, the funnels, the programs, the channels. Now we copy the proven patterns, adapt them to IPLoop's strengths (price, SDK, speed), and execute from day one looking like we've been in the game for years.

> **STRIKER:** These email templates are ready to send TODAY. Just need the landing page live and we're outreaching.

> **BLAZE:** The messaging guide gives us everything for the website copy. "Premium Proxies. Unbeatable Price. Free to Start." — I can build a landing page around that in hours.

> **SCOUT:** The app distribution playbook is gold. Reddit + YouTube + referral program is how every bandwidth app grew. We follow the same path.

> **SHADOW:** One more thing — the affiliate commissions in this industry are INSANE. 50% on first sale is standard. We need to match that if we want affiliates to promote us over Bright Data or Oxylabs. It's an investment in customer acquisition.
